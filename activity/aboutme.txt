Lanz Aldrin Bongon

I graduated in SHS last 2021 and wasn't able to continue to college because I got diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. I wasn't able to do the necessary actions to get myself fixed due to lack of finances. Now, I want to continue my study in computer science and be able to help my family financially so I thought Zuitt's tech course and open house bootcamps can help me in this journey to learn.

Isa pa lang po naging work experience ko pero saglit lang po siya. Last year lang po, nagwork kami ng kapatid ko in an air-dry clay making company as clay artists making a couple batches of souvenir items for a theme park. When I was in highschool, we learned the basics in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was invited by my teacher to attend a tech convention where I got to try coping in a different way using puzzle pieces to create the codes though I forgot the name of the program that we used and the convention itself.
