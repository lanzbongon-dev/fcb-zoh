Lanz Aldrin Bongon

I graduated in SHS last 2021 and wasn't able to continue to college because I got diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. I wasn't able to do the necessary actions to get myself fixed due to lack of finances. Now, I want to continue my study in computer science and be able to help my family financially so I thought Zuitt's tech course and open house bootcamps can help me in this journey to learn.
